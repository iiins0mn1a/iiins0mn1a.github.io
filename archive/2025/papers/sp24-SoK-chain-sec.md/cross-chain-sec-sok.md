# SoK:Security and Privacy of Blockchain Interoperability

## Abs
Cross-chain tech. 
Cross-chain hack about 3.1 Billion USD.
problem: Interoperability issue about -> overall framework flaw and user experience.
In this paper:
- systematic literature review;
    - 58 papers;
    - 154 

Findings:
- ...

## Notes
Contexts:
- Multi-chain arth improve all functionalities.
- **interoperability between `n` distributed systems**;
- This area called Interoperability Mechanisms(IMs) 
- This area is hard...
- New archs and sollutions? a lot;
- underscores the pressing need for rigorous research on IM sec.

Research perspective:
- what it is: a new boundary between chains;
- why it's a problem: 
    - why: chains themself has limitations;
    - Reality: cross chain TXs;

Real world data:
- loss over billions blabla...

RQs:
...

Methodology:
- papers from google scholar;
- gray literature resources about: A, B, C etc.

Primer:
- Blockchain interoperability allows data and value to flow across different domains and is facilitated by an IM.
- Interoperability Modes:
    - The literature..A,B,C etc. agrees on ...
    - 3 modes:
        - asset exchanges
            - like this:![exchange](image.png)
        - asset transfers
            - lock-mint or burn-mint pattern;
        - data transfers
    - diff mode has diff protocols


The security of a cross-chain system can be decomposed into the security of several layers. The existing literature supports similar breakdowns [48].
