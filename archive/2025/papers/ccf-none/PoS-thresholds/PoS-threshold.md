# Evaluating Attack Thresholds in Proof of Stake Blockchain Consensus Protocols
[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10895793/)

Actually this work is to analyze how to accumulate such amount of 1/3 stake power.

In this paper, I analyze the difficulty of a validator obtaining 1/3 stake.

Two methods are evaluated:
- Superior Returns Attack Threshold
- Random Attack Threshold

Validator's reward:
- Transaction Fees
- Validation Rewards
- Punishments


Superior Returns Attack Threshold 
- some other service provides a profit better than staking.

Random Attack Threshold (RAT):
- if some node has a good luck to receive more rewards in a period and it restake all its rewards back to staking pool. It can also have chance to win 1/3 stake.
