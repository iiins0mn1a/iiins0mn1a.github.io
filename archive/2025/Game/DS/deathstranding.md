# From Death Stranding to Flow State
**Flow State** is a mental state in which an individual becomes fully immersed in an activity, losing track of time while maintaining intense focus. In this state, one operates with heightened efficiency and creativity, often experiencing deep satisfaction afterward.

While everyone strives to achieve Flow State during work or study, gaming remains one of the most common domains where it occurs naturally. This is because games are meticulously designed to meet the *psychological prerequisites* for flow state: clear objectives, real-time feedback, and a balance between challenge and skill. By replicating these conditions in task design—such as breaking work into measurable milestones or adjusting difficulty dynamically—we can potentially induce flow state in non-gaming contexts.

Take *Death Stranding* as a prime example. Directed by Hideo Kojima—a director renowned for his *auteuristic* approach to game design—the game defies conventional expectations. Instead of combat or high-speed action, its core mechanic revolves around "boring" deliveries. Before its success, few believed such a concept could sustain engagement. Yet, like turning water into wine, Kojima’s design proves transformative. I argue it’s the perfect model for cultivating Flow State in work and study.

- 死亡搁浅：
    - 每完成一件事，要把另一件事提上日程；
    - 一件事情分两到三次做，且保证每一件事情完成的时候，都有事情做了一半；
    - 事情与事情的路线依赖认知；
    - 事情的正反馈认知：
        - 物质激励；
        - 道德激励；
        - 社交激励；
        - 责任激励；
    - 降低事物的阻碍：异步社交
